# OpenSource Sustainability Intelligence (OSSI)

A human‑centric platform to assess open‑source project health, maintainer workload, sustainability risk, and trust—so communities and companies can act before projects burn out.

---

## 🌍 Vision
Ensure the long‑term sustainability of open‑source projects by combining repository health metrics with human‑centric signals like maintainer workload and burnout risk.

## 🎯 Mission
Build a transparent, explainable platform that provides actionable insights and early warnings for projects at risk of abandonment or low trust.

---

## ✅ Core Objectives
- Analyze repository health metrics
- Evaluate maintainer workload and concentration
- Calculate bus factor and sustainability risk
- Provide a trust & sustainability score
- Generate actionable recommendations
- Offer a public dashboard with explainable metrics
